<p>Majority of the sprayer pumps available in market are back mounted, hand pumps that are used to spray pesticides. Pesticide spray pump have to be pumped manually and then carried on the back for spraying in the fields. Agriculture sprayer vehicle operates the pump automatically as it moves, pump is mounted on vehicle so no stress to operator, very low cost. The pumping mechanism is connected to the rear wheel shaft through a gear train. Thus motion of the wheel is converted into automatic pumping of the pumping system. Earlier designs were wither top mounted piston handle pumps or side mounted handle piston Pumps. Both of them are to be carried on the back.

  Thus the spraying pressure is developed only when the handle is pumped. This causes fatigue and makes the operator tired. For spraying action, the pump is to be continuously pumped by hand to develop sprayer pressure inside the tank, so also the pump with the filled liquid is heavy and has to be carried on the back, hence a simple system that pumps fluid and carries the pump on a vehicle so that operator does not have to carry the pump is needed. Crank link operated pump works automatically when vehicle is moved. The pumping mechanism is connected to the rear wheel shaft through a gear train. Thus motion of the wheel is converted into automatic pumping of the pumping system. Pump is carried on the moving vehicle, the pump is provided with two additional mechanism namely to uniformly spray the pesticides on the crop and secondly a solid fertilizer sprayer with the help of wheel motion. Project work involves the design development analysis of components, fabrication of the unit and testing the equipment to find performance parameters.</p>
