<td algin="center"><h3>Pressure Regulator:</h3>A Pressure regulator is a control valve that reduces the input pressure of a fluid to a desired value at its output. Regulators are used for gases and liquids, and can be an integral device with an output pressure setting, a restrictor and a sensor all in the one body, or consist of a separate pressure sensor, controller and flow valve.</td>

<td algin="center"><h3>Nozzle:</h3><p>A nozzle is a device designed to control the direction or characteristics of a fluid flow (especially to increase velocity) as it exits (or enters) an enclosed chamber or pipe.</p>
<p>A nozzle is often a pipe or tube of varying cross sectional area, and it can be used to direct or modify the flow of a fluid. Nozzles are frequently used to control the rate of flow, speed, direction, mass, shape, and the pressure of the stream that emerges from them. In a nozzle, the velocity of fluid increases at the expense of its pressure energy.</p>

<td algin="center"><h3>Sprocket:</h3>
<p>A sprocket or sprocket-wheel is a profiled wheel with teeth, or cogs, that mesh with a chain , track or other perforated or indented material. The name ‘sprocket’ applies generally to any wheel upon which radial projections engage a chain passing over it. It is distinguished from a gear in that sprockets are never meshed together directly, and differs from a pulley in that sprockets have teeth and pulleys are smooth.</p>
<p>Sprockets are used in bicycles, motorcycles, cars, tracked vehicles and other machinery either to transmit rotary motion between two shafts where gears are unsuitable or to impart linear motion to a track, tape etc. Perhaps the most common form of sprocket may be found in the bicycle, in which the pedal shaft carries a large sprocket-wheel, which drives a chain, which, in turn, drives a small sprocket on the axle of the rear wheel.</p>
<p>Early automobiles were also largely driven by sprocket and chain mechanism, a practice largely copied from bicycles.</p>
<p>Sprockets are of various designs, a maximum of efficiency being claimed for each by its originator. Sprockets typically do not have a flange. Some sprockets used with timing belts have flanges to keep the timing belt centred. Sprockets and chains are also used for power transmission from one shaft to another where slippage is not admissible, sprocket chains being used instead of belts or ropes and sprocket-wheels instead of pulleys. They can be run at high speed and some forms of chain are so constructed as to be noiseless even at high speed.</p>

<td algin="center"><h3>Chain:</h3>
<p>A bicycle chain is a roller chain that transfers power from the pedals to the drive-wheel of a bicycle, thus propelling it. Most bicycle chains are made from plain carbon or alloy steel, but some are nickel-plated to prevent rust, or simply for aesthetics.</p>
<p> A bicycle chain can be very energy efficient, one study reported efficiencies as high as 98.6%. The study, performed in a clean laboratory environment, found that efficiency was not greatly affected by the state of lubrication. A larger sprocket will give a more efficient drive because it moves the point of pressure farther away from the axle, placing less stress on the bearings, thus reducing friction in the inner wheel. Higher chain tension was found to be more efficient. "This is actually not in the direction you'd expect, based simply on friction".</p>

<td algin="center"><h3>Connecting Rod:</h3>
  <p>A connecting rod is a rigid member which connects a piston to a crank or crankshaft in a reciprocating engine. Together with the crank, it forms a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion.</p>
<p> A connecting rod may also convert rotating motion into reciprocating motion, its original use. Earlier mechanisms, such as the chain, could only impart pulling motion. Being rigid, a connecting rod may transmit either push or pull, allowing the rod to rotate the crank through both halves of a revolution. In a few two-stroke engines the connecting rod is only required to push.</p>
<p>  Today, the connecting rod is best known through its use in internal combustion piston engines, such as automobile engines. These are of a distinctly different design from earlier forms of connecting rod used in steam engines and steam locomotives.</p>

<td algin="center"><h3>Crank:</h3><p>The crank set (in the US) or chain set (in the UK), is the component of a bicycle drive train  that converts the reciprocating motion of the rider's legs into rotational motion used to drive the chain or belt, which in turn drives the rear wheel. It consists of one or more sprockets, also called chain rings or chain wheels attached to the cranks, arms, or crank arms to which the pedals attach. It is connected to the rider by the pedals, to the bicycle frame by the bottom bracket, and to the rear sprocket, cassette or freewheel via the chain. The two cranks, one on each side and usually mounted 180° apart, connect the bottom bracket axle to the pedals.</p>
<p>
Cranks are constructed of either an aluminium alloy, titanium, carbon fibber, chromoly steel, or some less expensive steel. Tubular steel cranks (such as Tioga's Revolver) can be light and very strong, are usually found on BMX bikes, and are slowly finding their way to mountain bikes (dirt jumping and urban assault). Aluminium cranks may be cast, hot forged or cold forged ("cold" in this context means the billet from which the crank is to be made is heated to a specified temperature well below the melting point, not room temperature). Cold forging gives the metal additional strength, and the cranks can therefore be made lighter without increasing the risk of breakage. Shimano "Hollowtech" aluminium cranks are made by forging the main arms around a hard steel insert which is then
withdrawn, leaving an internal void to save weight. They are then welded up before final machining.
