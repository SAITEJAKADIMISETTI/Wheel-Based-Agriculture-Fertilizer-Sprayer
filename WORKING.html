<p>When we push the system the wheel rotates and the sprockets is rigidly mounted on it & there is no relative motion between wheel & sprocket , and this sprocket is connected with another  sprocket called driven sprocket by the rollers, chain, and this sprocket is fixed on the driven shaft by with the help of the bush mechanism. The shaft is connected with a crank,  therefore the rotary motion of the wheel is converted into reciprocating motion.</p>
<p>For every one revolution of wheel the driven sprocket rotates 2.5 revaluations
due to the crank & chain mechanism. The velocity of the driven shaft varies according to the following theorem.

<p>T1  =  No. of  Tooth’s on the driver sprocket </p>
<p>T2  =  No. of  Tooth’s  on the driven sprocket</p>
<p>N1  =  Speed of the driven in rpm</p>
<p>N2  =  Speed of the driven in rpm</p>
<p>Velocity ratio</p>
<p>N2/N1    =    T1/T2</p>
<p>N2/N1    =    42/14  = 3</p>
<p>Due to  above velocity ration, for every revolution of the driver sprocket the driven sprocket rotates 3 times as driver sprocket.</p>
<p> For every revolution of driven shaft the crank makes two reciprocated motions like forward & backward , due to this the connecting rod on the crank makes two reciprocating movement & this crank is connected to the piston of the pump cylinder , so due to this movement the piston move up & down motion & the creates the suction & compression strokes.</p>
<p>In suction stroke, the low pressure is created in the pump cylinder that is below the atmospheric pressure (760 mm of Hg)</p>
<p>Due to that low pressure the liquid is suck into the pump cylinder through agitator, where the fluids are mixed homogeneously according to the ratio 1:1.</p>
<p> In compression stroke the high pressure is created & inlet valve closes automatically due to such high pressure the outlet valve is opened, due to mechanical energy (potential, kinematic & datum energy) difference the fluid is transferred from pump outlet to the required destination through varies intermediate connections , By using sprinklers the water will spray drop wise so spreading of the liquid will reach the required position.  </p>
